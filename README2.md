Deezy Visualizer

Hey everyone. Here's how to use.

mygraphics.js provides an example graphical display. Create your own .js file to implement the graphical design of your choosing. Then simply update sound.js according to the instructions at the top, and link your .js file in sound.html. 

have fun!

---------------------------
To view your product:
cd into the visualizer directory then execute the following command

python -m SimpleHTTPServer

Then in your browser go to:

localhost:8000/sound.html

If you don't have python installed then it's up to you to figure out how to locally host the webpage. Also your web browser may block microphone access, but you should be able to change these settings.

okay
