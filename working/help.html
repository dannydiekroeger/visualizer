			Welcome to the Audio Visualizer!</p>
			<p>We have a multitude of visual effects that you are able to access and explore.</p>

			<p>There are three main audio inputs. You can either choose an audio file from your desktop (Audio File: Choose File), choose from one of the existing audio files (URL Audio), or click the microphone button to take in audio from the background. </p>

			<p>To play the sound, choose your input, click submit, and then click play sound.</p>

			<p>All effects are listed and ordered in the left sidebar. Once "Play Sound" is clicked, select an effect category as well as a specific effect in that category. It will begin playing.</p>

			<p>To enter full screen mode, click the "Go Fullscreen" button in the top menu.</p>
